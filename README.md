# Repository dataptams202103module_3

Welcome to the repository dataptams202103module_3!

This repository contains the Ironhack labs for module_3 and the solutions, in two separate folders
`module_3` and `module_3_solutions`, respectively 

## General strategy

You will be creating your own repository by forking this repository on to your own
github account, the same way as you did with your prework. Subsequently  you can clone the repository on your machine and start working on it
 
## How to submit your labs
1. Complete the assigned lab in the module_3 folder. **Please do not create new files (unless specifically asked) but just fill out the lab file**
2. Add, commit and push the lab to your remote repository
3. Copy paste the link of your lab on your lab card, on the Trello board
4. Move your lab card on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/stdbBbKA/ironhack-data-analytics-032021) to "Done"
5. Check the Trello board here for more information on lab submission 

## Note on lab solutions and submissions
The folder `module_3_solutions`solutions contains the proposed solutions of the labs. You are expected to check yourself your solutions against the proposed solutions. The teaching staff will be here to support you in case you have doubts or you would like feedback on specific issues. **Of course you are still expected to submit all assigned labs within the deadlines and the submissions will be checked**
 
## Getting notebooks to run
Our main tool to perform data analysis and present results is Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab.
You should be able to start the notebook server by typing *jupyter lab* or *jupyter notebook*
in command line.
A useful cheatsheet to work more effectively with the Jupyter notebook
can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1slPTN3g9bepzE84FA6rAHl0OZB_GRR8G)
